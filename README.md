# CS245 - Practice Assignment 3

See assignment details on Canvas.

it keeps throwing me this error that says "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: LinearSearch".
now that the above error is gone it threw me this error, "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
                                                                 at Practice03Test.timeSearches(Practice03Test.java:82)
                                                                 at Practice03Test.main(Practice03Test.java:92)"

nut otherwise it worked with the default inout that he made.

my code should work (aside from recursive) but im not sure why it kept throwing me that nullpointer error,
which made no sense to me because there was no null value.
